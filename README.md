This is an example project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute the app.

 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
